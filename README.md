# VipersStalkerCoPMod
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat Mod

Repository holding scripts and configuration files for VipersStalkerCoPMod

The weapon mod merge makes it **impossible to fully build** this mod without models which are not included in the github repository due to high diskspace usage it would cause.
That is why this repository is only used an **internal version-control**.
